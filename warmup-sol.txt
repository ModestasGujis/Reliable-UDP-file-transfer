The channel used is unreliable (packets can be lost or arrive out of order). Server has no mechanism to detect this as it just sends the packets
and does not wait for any response. Meaning, that if a packet is lost, server doesn't know about it and doesn't resend it. That's what happened here.
Packet 3 was lost, client drops subsequent packets and just keeps sending ACK 2 and server ignores these ACKs.
That's why client doesn't have any lines above and equal 4. (line4 is packet 3)
